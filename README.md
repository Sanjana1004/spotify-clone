# LAB | HTML & CSS - Spotify Clone

## Introduction

Everybody likes music, right? Odds are, if you do, you have heard of **Spotify**.

In this lab, we will be building a simplified version of the Spotify landing page:

<br>

All of the necessary assets and images are already provided. You might also find it useful to resort to the **[full-length PDF version of the website](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/spotify-prototype.pdf)** as reference.



## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

You are provided with some assets - in the `images` folder, you will find the necessary images, and the text is ready for you in the `index.html` file. Write your HTML and CSS code in the `index.html` and `styles/style.css` files, respectively. Remember to follow the best practices.

The page is split into 4 sections, and we have generously cut it down into pieces!

In general, website designs don't just come out the wild, so you will most likely be having mockups/sketches that you will have to integrate. It is a good practice to help you out before coding to cut the website into pieces in order to help you out _**structuring**_ your HTML.

_**The last section isn't as detailed as the others ones, good luck**_ :smile:
